Why Plan for Retirement?

Here are some reasons why you should plan for retirement:
End of Working Years

After 30-40 years of professional service you retire as your body and mind require relaxation and relief from stress. However, this also means that you and your family cannot receive a steady monthly salary. A pension plan provides this support in the absence of a salary.
Increase in Average Life Expectancy

Nowadays, with a higher life expectancy rate, you'll need to ensure that you can save enough for your retirement fund to support you and your family after retirement. You need to plan well in advance in order to ensure a regular income during retirement.
The Rising Cost of Commodities

With inflation affecting the price of all commodities, you will need a regular income stream to meet your basic needs. After considering the inflation rate, you can determine your pension amount so that you can lead a comfortable life even with the increasing cost of goods.
Medical Emergencies

If there is a medical emergency in your retirement years, you should be prepared financially. Even if your savings are not enough, retirement planning or a pension plan may help you pay for the treatment.

How Do Retirement Plans Work?


A retirement plan works in two main stages:
 

    01
    Accumulation Phase
    During this phase, you pay regular premiums, which are invested in your chosen fund or asset. This continues for a fixed period to help grow your retirement savings.
    02
    Distribution (Vesting) Phase
    Once the plan matures, you reach the vesting stage. At this point, you can either start receiving regular pension payouts or withdraw the amount to buy an immediate annuity plan from the same provider.

Factors to Keep in Mind While Planning for Retirement

Here are some important factors to consider while planning for your retirement to ensure a comfortable and stress-free future.
Starting Age

Starting retirement preparations at least 15-20 years in advance can ensure a stable financial foundation, allowing for sufficient savings without disrupting current expenses.
Annuity Structure 

Choosing between accumulating funds through regular premiums or investing a lump sum determines how and when retirement benefits are received, aligning with financial goals and family needs.
Top-Up Flexibility

A retirement plan with top-up options enables enhanced payout benefits, offering increased financial security for unexpected expenses during retirement.
Risk Appetite 

You should consider your risk tolerance while planning the investment strategy. Those who begin retirement planning early may take on a higher risk than those starting at a later stage. If you begin early, you may invest in riskier but higher-returning assets like equities.
Types of Retirement Plans

An individual can plan for retirement by investing in a range of the best retirement plan in India that can provide an income stream to maintain their lifestyle post retirement. There are various retirement planning options in India, including annuities, retirement funds, market-linked investment plans, and the National Pension System (NPS).

    Immediate Annuity Plans

    An annuity plan provides regular monthly payments to a retired individual. Annuity payouts begin within a year after a lump sum investment is made. If you're getting close to retirement and want a feasible option, this can be a suitable one. 
    Deferred Annuity Plans

    This annuity allows the investor to determine the time period over which payouts will be made. Rather than making large payments over a short period of time, a person makes small payments over time.
    Senior Citizen Savings Scheme

    This government-backed scheme provides retirement income to individuals. Those who are over 60 years old can take advantage of this type of retirement investment plan, as well as those who are between 55 and 60 years old.
    National Pension System

    A person aged 18 to 70 is eligible to participate in the NPS. Tax benefits under this plan can reach Rs 2 lakhs in a financial year, and it can suit investors with a moderate to high appetite for risk. The reason for this is that usually investments are made in market-linked instruments, such as equities and debt funds. Additionally, investors can invest in corporate bonds, government bonds, and alternative investment funds. An investor's National Pension Scheme account matures at the age of 60. 

Eligibility Criteria for Retirement Plans

Below are the eligibility criteria for retirement plans in India:

    Entry Age: In India, the minimum age for enrolling in most retirement plans is 18. This way, individuals can take charge of their financial future early and benefit from compounding. Depending on the specific plan, there may be a higher entry age limit. Before choosing a plan, make sure you understand its eligibility requirements.
    Premiums: Your premium is the amount you contribute regularly to your retirement plan. Depending on your affordability and desired retirement income, you can choose these contributions. In some plans, you can adjust your premium contributions as your financial condition changes.
    Vesting Age: In retirement plans, vesting age refers to the age at which you can begin receiving retirement benefits. The age can vary depending on your specific plan, but it is typically between 40 and 80 years old. In some plans, you can purchase an immediate annuity, in which you begin receiving payments immediately after purchasing it. For retirement planning, it is crucial to know when you should start receiving annuity payments, since this determines when your retirement savings will be available to you.

How Much is Enough to Retire Stress-Free?

There is no one-size-fits-all retirement planning goal; your post-retirement income depends on your lifestyle, needs, and future plans. However, a few general rules can help you estimate how much to save.

    According to a general rule, after retirement, you'll need 70–80% of your pre-retirement income to live comfortably. For example, a person with a current income of 10 lakhs will likely need around 7-8 lakhs per year during retirement. In the event that you expect to live 20 years after retirement, that equates to 1.4 to 1.6 crores.

    A retirement corpus of at least 20–25 times your annual expenses is recommended by some experts. 

    To secure a financial future, you need to start saving early, invest wisely in the best retirement plan, and adjust your spending habits.

Other Aspects to Consider for Retirement Planning

 


While planning for retirement, it's important to consider your overall financial situation, including:

Medical insurance: An individual's health insurance needs increase as they age. Getting adequate medical insurance coverage well before you retire is recommended, since older age has higher premiums.  

Home: We often end up taking on a high level of liability when buying a home. For effective retirement planning, you should pay off your loan before you retire so that you do not have to bear the burden of the debt.

Estate planning: To prevent any hassle during your retirement, plan the distribution of your wealth and assets well in advance.
